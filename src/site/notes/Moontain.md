# Moontain

> [!quote] 我仍只是一只，追逐天涯的孤雁

**Moontain**, a compound word constructed with "moon" and "mountain". I use it to express a prudent imagination of a place far from the noise and bustle.

This site serves as a digital garden containing musings from me and treasures from others.
It's [open source](https://github.com/blleng/blog) for sure.

## Maturity Levels
Maturity level of each note has been decided subjectively by me. In fact, I need this maturity-identification system due to my immaturity.

### Seedling
Seedlings (![seedling|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/blleng/images/upload/note-icon-1.svg)) are thoughts barely started. Maybe jotted down on haste or simply showing only the brief amount of what I thought about it by far.

### Sapling
Saplings (![sapling|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/blleng/images/upload/note-icon-2.svg)) have a substantial amount of content, they may show periodical developmet derived from seedlings or fertilizer.

### Tree
Trees (![tree|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/blleng/images/upload/note-icon-3.svg)) are grown up coherent piece of thought/essay/expression that should not change much except for some editorial enhancements.

### Axe
Axe (![axe|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/blleng/images/upload/note-icon-4.svg)) are the notes expressing outdated views (totally or partially) and should be cutted. These contents are kept for historicity of thoughts.

### Fertilizer
Fertilizer (![fertilizer|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/blleng/images/upload/note-icon-6.svg)) are notes exported/extracted from other mediums (e.g. Reading highlight and notes). They provide nutrition for other notes to grow.

### Boots
boots (![boots|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/blleng/images/upload/note-icon-5.svg)) are notes that allow us to navigate easily (e.g. Collection of books or writings).
