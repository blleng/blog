## Abstract
The limitations of conventional strategies in finely controlling the composition and structure demand new promotional effects for upgrading the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) catalysts for enhanced fuel production. We report the design and synthesis of a hetero-dual-site catalyst for boosting RWGS performance by controllably loading Fe atoms at the neighboring Pt atom on the surface of commercial CeO2. The Fe–Pt/CeO2 exhibits a remarkably high catalytic performance (TOFPt: 43,519 h–1) for CO2 to CO conversion with ∼100% CO selectivity at a relatively low temperature of 350 °C. Furthermore, the catalyst retains over 80% activity after 200 h of continuous operation. The experimental and computational investigations reveal a “two-way synergistic effect”, where Fe atoms can not only serve as promotors to alter the charge density of Pt atoms but also be activated by the excess active hydrogen species generated by Pt atoms, enhancing catalytic activity and stability.
